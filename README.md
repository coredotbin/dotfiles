## Features
Interesting configurations and scripts you may find useful.

### Drop-in wallpaper
I just replace the file in `.config/wallpaper/` when I want to change it. This is done just by telling Sway to use any file in a certain directory:

```
set $wallpaper ~/.config/wallpaper/*
output * bg $wallpaper fill
```

### Waybar Spotify module
The Waybar Spotify module ships default with Waybar! You can find SibrenVasse's [mediaplayer.py script on the Waybar repository](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/blob/master/resources/custom_modules/mediaplayer.py).

## Waybar brightness module
Using [brightnessctl](https://github.com/Hummer12007/brightnessctl) to get the backlight brightness:

```
"custom/brightness": {
	"exec": "/usr/bin/brightnessctl --machine-readable | grep -o -E '([0-9]+%)'",
	"interval": 1,
	"format": "{} ïƒ«"
} 
```

## Wallpaper
The wallpaper is a photo of Little River in Tennessee that I took during my spring break last year.
